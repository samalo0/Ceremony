# Ceremony

This project is an Unreal Engine 4, C++ project that I made to learn multiplayer programming in Unreal Engine.

The game idea was to make something similar to Dark Souls that could be a battle royale style. The final state of the game is that it does work in multiplayer and has been tested with 4 players, where you can fight and die and respawn in a single arena.

To turn it into a real game would need a lot of art and design support, so I abandoned it at this level. I hope to revisit it again and add additional weapons, arenas, powerups, etc.
